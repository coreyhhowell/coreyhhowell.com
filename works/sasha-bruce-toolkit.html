                <p>
                  Sasha Bruce Youth (SBY) is a nonprofit organization based in
                  Washington, DC, dedicated to serving at-risk youth and their
                  families. As the organization approached a significant
                  anniversary milestone, they wanted to expand with large-scale
                  programs but faced several critical hurdles in scaling their
                  impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Initial discussions with SBY revealed that while they had
                  ambitious growth goals, their primary challenges centered
                  around limited community visibility and engagement.

                  As Project Manager and Human Experience Designer at 15Folks, I
                  was responsible for developing comprehensive solutions that
                  would:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Brand Awareness Strategy: </strong>Create systems to
                    increase SBY's visibility and community recognition
                    throughout Washington, DC
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Volunteer Experience Enhancement: </strong>Design
                    improved onboarding and support tools that would build
                    volunteer confidence and ensure meaningful impact
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Community Support Infrastructure: </strong>Develop
                    resources that would strengthen relationships between SBY,
                    youth, and broader community stakeholders
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Youth-Centered Design: </strong>Ensure all solutions
                    authentically represented and empowered the young people SBY
                    serves

                  <li>
                    Immersive Research Phase: Led comprehensive field research
                    by embedding with SBY's community for several weeks. Our
                    team participated in educational youth nights, engaged in
                    activities like music production and basketball, and
                    conducted interviews with youth, staff, and volunteers to
                    understand authentic needs and experiences.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Collaborative Design Process: Organized the team into three
                    specialized focus groups, each exploring different
                    opportunity areas. We balanced virtual collaboration using
                    Figma with in-person meetings, applying viability,
                    feasibility, and desirability frameworks to evaluate
                    concepts through structured divergent and convergent
                    thinking sessions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Stakeholder Validation: Organized intimate feedback
                    sessions, including having a nice breakfast together, to
                    ensure solutions aligned with organizational goals and
                    operational realities.

                    merchandise, improving volunteer experience through
                    structured communication tools, and strengthening community
                    support through toolkit's relationship-building resources.

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <h3>Listen Beyond the Initial Ask</h3>
            <p>
              Sometimes clients request solutions that don't address their
              underlying needs. By immersing ourselves in SBY's daily operations
              and building authentic relationships with youth, staff, and
              volunteers, we discovered that program expansion wasn't the
              answer—strategic brand building and community engagement tools
              were. The real value came from pivoting to what the organization
              actually needed rather than what they initially requested.
            </p>

            <h3>Authentic Co-Creation Requires Genuine Participation</h3>
            <p>
              True youth-centered design means more than just interviewing young
              people—it requires participating in their world and placing
              creative power directly in their hands. By joining educational
              nights, playing basketball, and making music together, we built
              trust that enabled meaningful collaboration. The most successful
              outcomes emerged when youth had actual art direction authority,
              not just input opportunities.
            </p>

            <h3>Sustainable Impact Matches Organizational Capacity</h3>
            <p>
              The most elegant solution isn't always the most ambitious one.
              While the pop-up activation toolkit seemed exciting, recognizing
              SBY's actual capacity led us to focus on merchandise co-creation
              and anniversary toolkit solutions that built on existing
              strengths. Effective design for nonprofits means creating tools
              that organizations can realistically implement and sustain
              long-term.
