                <h3>Situation</h3>
                <p>
                  Findependent, a financial advisory firm, was struggling to
                  engage their target demographic of adults in their early to
                  mid-20s. Despite offering valuable financial advisory
                  services, the company lacked a digital presence that resonated
                  with younger users who increasingly expect mobile-first
                  experiences for managing their finances.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The firm recognized that traditional financial services often
                  alienate younger users with complex terminology, intimidating
                  interfaces, and products that don't address their specific
                  life circumstances. Young adults in this demographic face
                  unique financial challenges—from student loans and entry-level
                  salaries to navigating financial independence for the first
                  time—yet most financial apps are designed for established
                  adults with more complex financial portfolios.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Findependent needed a mobile solution that could bridge this
                  gap while positioning them as a trusted partner for financial
                  planning rather than just another advisory service.

                <h3>Task</h3>
                <p>
                  Our challenge was to design a financial technology solution
                  that would:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Financial Education: Demystify complex financial terminology
                    and concepts to make finance accessible and less
                    intimidating for young adults
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Behavioral Change: Design features that would encourage
                    positive financial behaviors, particularly around savings
                    and investing habits
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Value Proposition Enhancement: Improve Findependent's
                    competitive positioning by creating unique value that would
                    attract customers and drive revenue growth
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Action</h3>
                <p>
                  Our team executed a comprehensive user-centered design
                  process:
                </p>

                <h4>User Research:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Conducted comprehensive research combining both in-person
                    and virtual interviews with international students to
                    understand their specific financial challenges and needs.
                    This research helped validate our hypothesis that
                    international students represented a significant opportunity
                    for Findependent.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Persona Development & Journey Mapping:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Created detailed user personas based on research findings
                    and mapped complete user journeys to identify key pain
                    points and opportunities for intervention. This foundational
                    work ensured all design decisions were grounded in real user
                    needs rather than assumptions.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Strategic Refinement:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Based on testing feedback, made significant strategic
                    decisions includin: Streamlined the overall design for
                    better coherence and usability, Scaled down the feature set
                    to focus on core user needs within realistic development
                    constraints, Removed complex investment features in favor of
                    more foundational financial tools, Eliminated the document
                    assistant to focus on core financial management needs
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Result</h3>
                <h4>Solution Delivered:</h4>
                <p>
                  The International Student Financial Platform successfully
                  addressed the unique needs of international students by
                  providing accessible, educational, and culturally-sensitive
                  financial tools.
                </p>

                <h4>Key Outcomes:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>User-Centered Design Solution:</strong> Created a
                    mobile experience specifically tailored to international
                    students' financial needs, addressing pain points that
                    existing financial apps overlook. The solution balanced
                    financial education with practical tools, making complex
                    financial concepts accessible to users navigating the US
                    financial system for the first time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Strategic Focus Achievement:</strong> The final
                    prototype successfully addressed all three original
                    objectives—demystifying financial terminology through clear,
                    educational interfaces; encouraging positive financial
                    behaviors through simplified, actionable features; and
                    establishing Findependent's unique value proposition in
                    serving international students.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Iterative Design Success:</strong> Demonstrated
                    strong UX methodology by using usability testing feedback to
                    make strategic product decisions, showing the value of
                    user-centered design in creating focused, viable solutions
                    rather than feature-heavy products that don't serve core
                    needs.

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p>
              This project reinforced the importance of cultural sensitivity and
              accessibility in financial technology design. The most effective
              solutions for underserved populations are those that address both
              functional needs and cultural barriers.
            </p>

            <h3>Technologies & Tools</h3>
            <p>
              Figma, user research, prototyping, financial APIs, multilingual
              design, cultural design, accessibility, financial education
            </p>

            <h3>Team & Collaboration</h3>
            <p>
              Worked closely with international students, financial experts, and
              cultural consultants to ensure the solution addressed real needs
              while respecting cultural differences and accessibility
              requirements.
